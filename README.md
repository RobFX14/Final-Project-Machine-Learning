# Final-Project-Machine-Learning

Overview
With devices such as the Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is possible to collect a large amount of personal activity data considerably inexpensively. These types of devices are part of quantified self-movement: a group of users who take action on themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are fans of technology and physical exercise. One thing that people do on a regular basis is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, we will use accelerometer data on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell from 6 participants. They were asked to perform correctly and incorrectly barbell lifts in 5 different ways.

The data consists of two types of data sets: training and test data (which will be used to validate the selected model).

The central idea of the project is to predict how they performed the exercise. This is the variable “class” in the training set. You can use any of the other variables to predict. Our goal is to predict the labels of the observations in the test set.
